#Microsoft Azure Event Hubs Clients

This repository provides client-side libraries for interacting with Microsoft Azure Event Hubs.

At present, there is a [client available in C (C99)](./C) and a [client for Java](./Java). 

These clients are distinct projects and optimized for the respective language, and differ in terms of API shape and capabilities.   

Details about how to build and use the clients and how to explore and run the samples can be found in the respective READMEs

* The *Azure Event Hub Client for Java* is production ready with full Microsoft product support. You can learn about its
  capabilities and also about how to contribute extensions and fixes in the  [README for the Java client](./java/readme.md)
* The *Azure Event Hub Client for C* is currently in "preview" state, meaning that there is ongoing work to bring it 
  to a state where Microsoft can provide full product support. Learn more in the [README for the C client](./c/readme.md)
